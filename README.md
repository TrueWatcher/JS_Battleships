# JS_Battleships
yet another implementation of Battleship game in JavaScript (and Php for online playing)

as of v.2.1.6 22 Mar 2017:
- you can install all files on your server and enjoy network playing (server must support Php >=5.5 with Sqlite3)
- you may play offline against local JS script even without server installation, just by copying all files to your local folder and opening index.html in browser
- allows to chose between several variants of rules before playing
- allows cheat mode when you can see enemy's ships (offline only)

TODOs:
- code cleanup
